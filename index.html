<h2>QUICK POLL</h2>
<p>
	Should Power Crystals drop when depleted?

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Hearth Well is a mod about construction. Without leaving your house
	you will get the materials you need to build everything you want.
	Between crafting simple blocks and building multi-block structures,
	you will never be idle.
</p>
<p>
	The objectives of this mod are that you build the machines you need 
	(and hopefully have fun doing it) to give purpose to your home space,
	and that everything is as simple as possible, without complex GUI's or numbers,
	while still having enough diversity to keep you engaged to progress through the mod.
